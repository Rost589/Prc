2. The program identifies all vowel letters (`a, e, i, o, u, y`) in the string and stores them.  
3. It then finds all consonant letters and counts them.  
4. The result is displayed in the following format:  
   ```  
   (list of vowels, number of consonants, list of consonants)  
   ```  

## Example Usage
